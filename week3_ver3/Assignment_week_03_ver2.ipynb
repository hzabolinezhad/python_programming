    "# Week 03 Assignment Covid\n",
    "\n",
    "New types of data and new data science technologies enable new research. These new technologies are technologies such as the ability to combine existing data or the ability to generate synthetic data from existing knowledge. This week casus is based on such research. Data is generated by Synthea's COVID-19 module. The data was constructed using three peer-reviewed publications published in the early stages of the global pandemic, when less was known, along with emerging resources, data, publications, and clinical knowledge. The simulation outputs synthetic Electronic Health Records (EHR), including the daily consumption of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and other medical devices and supplies. The Data is stored in separate tables to avoid redundancy, with as a concequence that tables need to be combined and reorganized in dataframes for analysing purpose.\n",

    "Keywords: merge data, subset data, clean data, generate data\n",

    "You will learn about combining data with pandas and numpy and you will learn to visualize with bokeh. Concretely, you will preprocess the partly Synthetic Covid data in an appropiate format in order to conduct statistical and visual analysis. Learning objectives\n",

    "- Combine multiple data sources for analysis\n",
    "- Read, inspect, clean, reshape data\n",
    "- Visualize data using bokeh\n",
    "- Maintain development environment \n",
    "- Apply coding standards and FAIR principles\n",
    "- Reshape the dataset into a format suitable for visual and statistical analysis\n",
    "- Use widgets to make the plot interactive \n",
    "- Use GIS libraries to plot geographical data\n",
